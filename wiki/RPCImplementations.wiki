#summary Links to Protocol Buffers RPC implementation projects.

A number of people are working on RPC systems based on protobuf.  ZeroC's [http://zeroc.com/ice.html Ice] now supports [http://www.zeroc.com/labs/protobuf/index.html encoding messages using Protocol Buffers], though it requires defining RPC services in a separate file and language, not `.proto`-style RPC definitions.  There are also some experimental implementations of pure-protobuf RPC:
